# Interactive Nmap Tool

## Overview

This project is a **Python-based interactive tool** that simplifies the use of Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool. It features an easy-to-navigate menu system with categorized scan options, making it accessible for both beginners and advanced users. By automating the command construction process, this tool eliminates the need to remember complex Nmap commands.

## Features

### 1. **Categorized Scans**

The tool organizes Nmap commands into the following categories:

- **Basic Scans**:
  - Quick Scan
  - Intense Scan
  - Ping Scan
  - Scan multiple targets
  - Scan Specific Ports
- **Advanced Scans**:
  - OS Detection
  - Service Version Detection
  - Aggressive Scan
  - Trace Route
  - Detect Scriptable Services
- **Vulnerability Scans**:
  - Default Scripts
  - Vulnerability Detection Scripts
  - Brute Force Scripts
  - Malware Detection
- **Timing Scans**:
  - From Paranoid (slow) to Insane (fast)
- **Evasion Scans**:
  - Decoy scans, proxy support, IPv6 scanning, and more.

### 2. **Target Input**

After selecting a scan type, users are prompted to input the target (IP address, hostname, or network range).

### 3. **Custom Scans**

Advanced users can input custom Nmap commands directly.

### 4. **Real-Time Execution**

The selected Nmap command is executed in real-time, and results are displayed in the terminal.

### 5. **Error Handling**

Handles missing tools, invalid inputs, and execution errors gracefully.
